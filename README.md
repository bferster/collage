# C O L L A G E - 3D collage animation tool


Collage is a simple web-based tool to compose and animate objects over time in a true 3-D space. These objects can be 3D models, lights, camera, image planes, web-pages, and room environments. Each can be animated over time controlling the position, scale, rotation, and transparency. Collage uses a timeline-based keyframe system and keyframes with controllable eases and full cut and paste options. There is unlimited undo and redo available. The projects are stored in the author’s Google Drive account.
